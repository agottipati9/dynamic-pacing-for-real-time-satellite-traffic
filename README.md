# Dynamic Pacing for Real-time Satellite Traffic

This repository contains the official artifacts and instructions to reproduce the experiments in our paper, "Dynamic Pacing for Real-time Satellite Traffic."

Our work integrates imitation learning with network pacing to stabilize video calls over LEO satellite networks. Reproducing our results relies on network emulation and is best performed using our **CloudLab** profile.

## Project Status & Reproducibility

**Repository Status: Archived**: This project is now archived. Please be aware that this repository is provided as a research artifact to accompany our paper. While the repository will remain public, please note that support is not available, and issues or pull requests may not be reviewed.

**A Note on Stochasticity**: Due to the inherent stochasticity in the emulated constellations, you can expect minor variations in the results on each run. For the most consistent results, we recommend averaging metrics over a few hundred videoconferencing calls.

## Getting Started: How to Reproduce

The most reliable way to run our experiments is with the provided CloudLab profile, which handles all dependencies and configuration.

1.  **Access the Profile**: Navigate to our profile page on CloudLab.
    > **‚òÅÔ∏è [Dynamic Pacing Experiment Profile](https://www.cloudlab.us/p/c691f036f0356409824c168ed4b1f9034a7ab9c7)**
2.  **Start the Experiment**: Click "Instantiate" on the profile page. You must select the **Emulab cluster** due to hardware dependencies. The profile will automatically set up part of the environment on the requested nodes.
3.  **Run the Code**: Once the experiment is active, you can log in to the nodes. The core implementation code will be pre-loaded, and you can follow the instructions in that profile's README to configure the environment and run the evaluation scripts.
