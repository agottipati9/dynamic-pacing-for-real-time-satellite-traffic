# Dynamic Pacing for Real-time Satellite Traffic

This repository contains the official artifacts and instructions to reproduce the experiments in our paper, "Dynamic Pacing for Real-time Satellite Traffic."

Our work integrates imitation learning with network pacing to stabilize video calls over LEO satellite networks. Reproducing our results relies on network emulation and is best performed using our **CloudLab** profile.

## Getting Started: How to Reproduce

The most reliable way to run our experiments is with the provided CloudLab profile, which handles all dependencies and configuration.

1.  **Access the Profile**: Navigate to our profile page on CloudLab.
    > **‚òÅÔ∏è [Dynamic Pacing Experiment Profile](https://www.cloudlab.us/p/c691f036f0356409824c168ed4b1f9034a7ab9c7)**
2.  **Start the Experiment**: Click "Instantiate" on the profile page. You must select the **Emulab cluster** due to hardware dependencies. The profile will automatically set up part of the environment on the requested nodes.
3.  **Run the Code**: Once the experiment is active, you can log in to the nodes. The core implementation code will be pre-loaded, and you can follow the instructions in that repository's README to configure the environment and run the evaluation scripts.
